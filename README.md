## How to add translations for your language

You can use Weblate to translate the app to your language:

https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluffychat/



1. Replace the non-translated string in the codebase:
```
Text("Hello world"),
```
with a method call:
```
Text(L10n.of(context).helloWorld),
```

and add the following import if missing:

```
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/l10n.dart';
```

2. Add the string to `/lib/l10n/l10n_en.arb`:

(The following example need to be sorounded by the usual json `{}` and after the `@@locale` key)

Example A:
```
"helloWorld": "Hello World!",
"@helloWorld": {
  "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
}
```

Example B:
```
"hello": "Hello {userName}",
"@hello": {
  "description": "A message with a single parameter",
  "placeholders": {
    "userName": {
      "type": “String”,
      “example”: “Bob”
    }
  }
}
```

3. For testing just run a regular build without extras
