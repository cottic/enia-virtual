## How to add translations for your language

You can use Weblate to translate the app to your language:

https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluffychat/



1. Replace the non-translated string in the codebase:
```
Text("Hello world"),
```
with a method call:
```
Text(L10n.of(context).helloWorld),
```
And add the method to `/lib/l10n/l10n.dart`:
```
String get helloWorld => Intl.message('Hello world');
```

2. Add the string to the .arb files with this command:
```
flutter pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/l10n/l10n.dart
```

3. Copy the new translation objects from `/lib/l10n/intl_message.arb` to `/lib/l10n/intl_<yourlanguage>.arb` and translate it or create a new file for your language by copying `intl_message.arb`.

4. Update the translations with this command:
```
flutter pub pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/l10n/l10n.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
```

5. Make sure your language is in `supportedLocales` in `/lib/main.dart` and in the List at `https://gitlab.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat-flutter/-/blob/master/lib/l10n/l10n.dart#L11`.
